I have been doing property for more than a decade and my expertise lies in HDB upgrading and downgrading for my clients. If you are simply considering a change of locations, I am the right  person  for you to seek advice. 

I used to stay in a 5-Room HDB flat in Sengkang, and at a young age of my twenties, I managed to buy my very own private property. We bought our first matrimonial flat under the walk in selection scheme which is now called balance sales of flats. When property market picked up, we sold it at a profit and shifted nearby my parents’ place. We bought a 4 room flat and when the property market picked up again, we sold the property at a profit and upgraded to a private property before I turned 30 years old. If you are considering the same options, you can achieve this too with the right calculations and planning. 

Like you, initially I was scared and definitely skeptical that I could not finance the loan. However, after doing some meticulous financial planning and calculations, I proceeded with the purchase. It was a decision which I have never regretted. To date, I have converted many of my clients clients to walk the same journey as me, and they have never been happier. For clients who have their own a private property and would want to multiply their wealth using property as a platform, I am most willing to share with you how to go about doing it. 

If you have the intention to upgrade, downgrade, and sell your property, do call or whatsapp me. I will be most willing to assist you.",https://www.carousell.sg/p/free-property-consultation-261979105

,,,,3A,822161,Punggol,161b Punggol Central,Maria Mariana ,ERA REALTY NETWORK PTE LTD,,R027004D,98322390,,"Hi, I'm Maria Mariana from Propnex. If you are looking for an experienced Property Agent, I am here for you.

I have been doing property for more than a decade and my expertise lies in HDB upgrading and downgrading for my clients. If you are simply considering a change of locations, I am the right  person  for you to seek advice. 

I used to stay in a 5-Room HDB flat in Sengkang, and at a young age of my twenties, I managed to buy my very own private property. We bought our first matrimonial flat under the walk in selection scheme which is now called balance sales of flats. When property market picked up, we sold it at a profit and shifted nearby my parents’ place. We bought a 4 room flat and when the property market picked up again, we sold the property at a profit and upgraded to a private property before I turned 30 years old. If you are considering the same options, you can achieve this too with the right calculations and planning. 

Like you, initially I was scared and definitely skeptical that I could not finance the loan. However, after doing some meticulous financial planning and calculations, I proceeded with the purchase. It was a decision which I have never regretted. To date, I have converted many of my clients clients to walk the same journey as me, and they have never been happier. For clients who have their own a private property and would want to multiply their wealth using property as a platform, I am most willing to share with you how to go about doing it. 

If you have the intention to upgrade, downgrade, and sell your property, do call or whatsapp me. I will be most willing to assist you.",https://www.carousell.sg/p/free-property-consultation-261979105

What can leads to unexpected and painful surprises is at times, many sellers do not have a clear picture of their current financial situation before selling their property. Before you make the decision to sell, a financial planning may be very helpful which includes assessing your income, debts, and any upcoming expenses during your move.
Consider contacting your bank or a mortgage advisor to understand exactly how much you owe on your current home. This, along with your target sale price, and the total cost of selling a home, will give you a general idea of how much money you may walk away with after the sale.

Not Getting your Loan Pre-Approved (IPA)
Many buyers are too excited and eager to jump into viewing of properties when they thought of buying a home and tense to missed out another important steps which is also a common mistake, buyers should understand what an In-principle Approval (IPA) is and obtaining one.

When you require to sell your current home in order to buy a new one, you’ll want to calculate how much you can afford. What you can afford often depends on your total monthly expenses, for example your car loan, student loans, credit card repayment etc. Your available cash flow in savings is to be prepared to cover any unexpected repairs or emergencies that could arise. Not forgetting to think about how your home purchase fits with your other long-term financial goals like saving for retirement.

I have been doing property for more than a decade and my expertise lies in HDB upgrading and downgrading for my clients. If you are simply considering a change of locations, I am the right  person  for you to seek advice. 

I used to stay in a 5-Room HDB flat in Sengkang, and at a young age of my twenties, I managed to buy my very own private property. We bought our first matrimonial flat under the walk in selection scheme which is now called balance sales of flats. When property market picked up, we sold it at a profit and shifted nearby my parents’ place. We bought a 4 room flat and when the property market picked up again, we sold the property at a profit and upgraded to a private property before I turned 30 years old. If you are considering the same options, you can achieve this too with the right calculations and planning. 

Like you, initially I was scared and definitely skeptical that I could not finance the loan. However, after doing some meticulous financial planning and calculations, I proceeded with the purchase. It was a decision which I have never regretted. To date, I have converted many of my clients clients to walk the same journey as me, and they have never been happier. For clients who have their own a private property and would want to multiply their wealth using property as a platform, I am most willing to share with you how to go about doing it. 

If you have the intention to upgrade, downgrade, and sell your property, do call or whatsapp me. I will be most willing to assist you.",https://www.carousell.sg/p/looking-to-sell-your-property-or-upgrade-i-can-help-with-your-property-related-matters-263369297

I have been doing property for more than a decade and my expertise lies in HDB upgrading and downgrading for my clients. If you are simply considering a change of locations, I am the right  person  for you to seek advice. 

I used to stay in a 5-Room HDB flat in Sengkang, and at a young age of my twenties, I managed to buy my very own private property. We bought our first matrimonial flat under the walk in selection scheme which is now called balance sales of flats. When property market picked up, we sold it at a profit and shifted nearby my parents’ place. We bought a 4 room flat and when the property market picked up again, we sold the property at a profit and upgraded to a private property before I turned 30 years old. If you are considering the same options, you can achieve this too with the right calculations and planning. 

Like you, initially I was scared and definitely skeptical that I could not finance the loan. However, after doing some meticulous financial planning and calculations, I proceeded with the purchase. It was a decision which I have never regretted. To date, I have converted many of my clients clients to walk the same journey as me, and they have never been happier. For clients who have their own a private property and would want to multiply their wealth using property as a platform, I am most willing to share with you how to go about doing it. 

If you have the intention to upgrade, downgrade, and sell your property, do call or whatsapp me. I will be most willing to assist you.",https://www.carousell.sg/p/looking-to-sell-your-property-or-upgrade-i-can-help-with-your-property-related-matters-263369297

,,,,3A,730511,Woodlands,511 Woodlands Drive 14,Maria Mariana ,ERA REALTY NETWORK PTE LTD,,R027004D,98322390,,"Hi, I'm Maria Mariana from Propnex. If you are looking for an experienced Property Agent, I am here for you.

I have been doing property for more than a decade and my expertise lies in HDB upgrading and downgrading for my clients. If you are simply considering a change of locations, I am the right  person  for you to seek advice. 

I used to stay in a 5-Room HDB flat in Sengkang, and at a young age of my twenties, I managed to buy my very own private property. We bought our first matrimonial flat under the walk in selection scheme which is now called balance sales of flats. When property market picked up, we sold it at a profit and shifted nearby my parents’ place. We bought a 4 room flat and when the property market picked up again, we sold the property at a profit and upgraded to a private property before I turned 30 years old. If you are considering the same options, you can achieve this too with the right calculations and planning. 

Like you, initially I was scared and definitely skeptical that I could not finance the loan. However, after doing some meticulous financial planning and calculations, I proceeded with the purchase. It was a decision which I have never regretted. To date, I have converted many of my clients clients to walk the same journey as me, and they have never been happier. For clients who have their own a private property and would want to multiply their wealth using property as a platform, I am most willing to share with you how to go about doing it. 

If you have the intention to upgrade, downgrade, and sell your property, do call or whatsapp me. I will be most willing to assist you.",https://www.carousell.sg/p/looking-to-sell-your-property-or-upgrade-i-can-help-with-your-property-related-matters-263369297

,99 Years,,,5A,543204,Sengkang,,OH WEE YONG,PROPNEX REALTY PTE LTD,,R052540I,97509878,,"Are you aware that the HDB that you are staying right now is
actually a Depreciating Asset?!
Put it very simply...your HDB value will eventually run down to 0-ZERO
when the 99-year lease lapsed.
You may have heard from your friends or colleagues or relatives or
even your neighbour that they are Upgrading to Private Property or EC.

You are at the RIGHT place IF you are asking Yourself:
""I don't know is NOW the right time to Upgrade?""
""I don't think whether I can AFFORD to Upgrade""
""I don't know HOW can I upgrade""   
""I don't know WHAT property to go next?""
""Is it RISKY to Upgrade""
""WHAT IF......?""
Or simply ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT!!""
These are all valid concerns.
Are you willing to talk to a Real Estate professional to get a clearer picture?
Or do you want to continue to assume and ultimately miss the great time and opportunity to make the great move? (pun intended)

Frankly, Upgrading and Asset Progression is one of the biggest
and important decision that you will make and of course you are 
stress, anxious and also eager to know how you can achieve in doing so.
You really should plan and start early so that you will have more
choices ahead.

Talk to me with a Free Consultation on how you can take the 1st step.
Totally no obligation and no risk and no stress!
The consultaion will usually last about 1 hour.
However it almost always will over-run as I have so much stuffs to share 
with you and I will answer all your doubts and enquiries that you have.
Just shoot me with all your questions...
Don't leave the consultation with questions still unanswered in your mind!

I am committed to assist you to achieve your Housing Needs and Financial Goals.

Oh...you are still reading and thinking what should you do next..
A good move NOW will be to call/whatsapp me at 97509878 to chope the consultation slot with me
You will be glad that you did so and be prepared to be amazed with the amount and 
quality of information and figures that you will achieve from the sharing.
No Obligation whatsoever, and you can walk away full of knowledge or take action with the knowledge gained.

There are many people earning $3K to $5K Monthly Income, but still don’t have much saving, why? Singapore everything is expensive?

How can we create wealth?
Even if we don’t have cash to buy condo, can we buy HDB to create wealth? Yes.

Case Study:
One Single Man, 35 yrs old, staying with parents, cpf got $60K only & bank only $5K, his income $3,400

After he meet me, I work out, with his income & age, he can take HDB loan 2.6% & 25 yrs, can loan about $224K, plus his cpf, he can buy a HDB old 3rm flat around $280K

1st 5 years, he can rent out his master room & stay in the common room, rental $900 estimated.

So his monthly Instalment $1,020
- his cpf OA contribution $700
- Master Room Rental $900
= positive Cash flow $580

If he save $580 monthly x 12 months x 5 years = $34,800

He can save $34,800 in his bank

After 5 years, he can stay with his parent & rent out the whole 3rm flat at around $1,600

So his monthly Instalment $1,020
- his cpf OA Contribution $700
- collect rental $1,600
= positive Cash Flow $1,280

After another 5 years, he can save
$1,280 x 12 months x 5 years
= $76,800

Total $34,800 + $76,800
= $111,600

He save $111,600 in his bank in 10 years.

If he do nothing & continue stay with his parents for another 10 years, how much saving in his bank do you think he has in 10 years? Maybe still $5K or $0",https://www.carousell.sg/p/learn-about-asset-progression-1000337879

Perfect for singles or couples to convert the new second bedroom into a walk-in closet/study/child’s room (currently furnished with a twin size loft bed with study table underneath and a wardrobe).

For shopping/dining, endless options are available at nearby City Square Mall, Mustafa Centre, Plaza Singapura, Pek Kio Market & Food Centre, Tekka Centre. One bus stop away (from bus stop 50011) is United Sq and Novena Sq/Velocity. Farrer Park MRT to HarbourFront MRT/VivoCity is a 13-min direct train ride. There are plenty of services/amenities within a walking radius as well.

*Within 1km* to St Joseph’s Institution Junior (you are virtually guaranteed a spot in Phase 2C for parents with no prior relationship with the school). Just across the road, there is co-ed school Farrer Park Primary which is also an MOE Kindergarten.

No extension required - not currently occupied and purely selling. Be prepared to pay at least $30K COV to secure this unique and well-located quality-furnished unit. Last offer $514,000.

I have been in the property industry for more than 10 years. Previously, I have worked with big organisations with the finance sector and prestigious banks in Singapore. I did countless roadshows during my stint in the bank. Hence, I am no stranger to the financial and property market. Meeting and communicating with people is my forte.

I started off doing HDBs. I evolved to convert my clients to purchase Executive Condominiums and PTE properties when I made my own PTE property purchase in my twenties. Many clients walked in my footsteps and trusted me to guide and do my best for them. Most clients became friends, and they are my biggest supporters by referring me to their loved ones.

I have been doing property for more than a decade and my expertise lies in HDB upgrading and downgrading for my clients. If you are simply considering a change of locations, I am the right  person  for you to seek advice. 

I used to stay in a 5-Room HDB flat in Sengkang, and at a young age of my twenties, I managed to buy my very own private property. We bought our first matrimonial flat under the walk in selection scheme which is now called balance sales of flats. When property market picked up, we sold it at a profit and shifted nearby my parents’ place.

,99 Years,Mid,Partial,4A,520928,Tampines,928 Tampines Street 91,,,,,,,"*There are some old posts of this house on property websites by agents. This was when we wanted to sell the prop early last year during covid but we changed plans and removed the unit from the market. Kindly ignore those posts. As all would know, resale prices have gone up in the last year (if there are concerns over prices listed in older posts). This is just FYI - to quell any concerns/misunderstanding. We only started considering selling on 27th March 2021 again.

Key Features.
1) Newly renovated in 2015 and well maintained. Owned by a couple, selling because we have a kid and wish to move close to parents in Sengkang. 
2) Renovation cost in 2015 was about 50k and key cost component was hacking and redoing of all tiles, including toilets, built-in wardrobes, l-box lighting, electrical works, kitchen glass door, kitchen cabinet, panasonic air-cons, wall plastering and painting amongst others.
3) House has 2 main doors (one that leads to staircase and one that leads to a lift. Both areas provide you with recess area for plants/cloths rack.
4) Tampines West MRT is literally 100m walk. .
5) Bus-stop has many buses to several areas in SG.
6) Safra is opposite
7) Bedok Reservoir a short walk away
8) Hub and Tamp Central is 2 stops/a short walk away
9) Changi Hospital nearby
10) Changi Business Park a few stops away via bus 118. Changi Airport within 10 mins via bus 27. 
11) Many coffee shops, mom and pop shops in the vicinity (Round Market, Street 81, Hub, Mall) 
12) St Hildas School within 1km
13) Door north-east facing
14) Spacious with a great layout
15) Apparently, you can break down the bomb shelter and make one of the rooms bigger, since its an older unit.

Location is really good (the reason we bought it in the first place). Flat is 37 years old (TOP: 1984). Across Safra, new HDBs are coming up. We have renovated it in a way without over-doing it, so anyone moving in can still add elements to touch up the house to make it your own wo really doing a complete overhaul

Viewing for serious buyers only. I am not selling through an agent. So appreciate serious buyers only since it does take time setting up viewing etc (since we have a kid now, and go up and down to parents often). 

Thanks! If you have any queries, please feel free to contact me, will be more than happy to answer your queries...

I have been doing property for more than a decade and my expertise lies in HDB upgrading and downgrading for my clients. If you are simply considering a change of locations, I am the right  person  for you to seek advice. 

I used to stay in a 5-Room HDB flat in Sengkang, and at a young age of my twenties, I managed to buy my very own private property. We bought our first matrimonial flat under the walk in selection scheme which is now called balance sales of flats. When property market picked up, we sold it at a profit and shifted nearby my parents’ place. We bought a 4 room flat and when the property market picked up again, we sold the property at a profit and upgraded to a private property before I turned 30 years old. If you are considering the same options, you can achieve this too with the right calculations and planning. 

Like you, initially I was scared and definitely skeptical that I could not finance the loan. However, after doing some meticulous financial planning and calculations, I proceeded with the purchase. It was a decision which I have never regretted. To date, I have converted many of my clients clients to walk the same journey as me, and they have never been happier. For clients who have their own a private property and would want to multiply their wealth using property as a platform, I am most willing to share with you how to go about doing it. 

If you have the intention to upgrade, downgrade, and sell your property, do call or whatsapp me. I will be most willing to assist you.",https://www.carousell.sg/p/looking-to-sell-your-property-or-upgrade-i-can-help-with-your-property-related-matters-263369297

Like you, initially I was scared and definitely skeptical that I could not finance the loan. However, after doing some meticulous financial planning and calculations, I proceeded with the purchase. It was a decision which I have never regretted. To date, I have converted many of my clients clients to walk the same journey as me, and they have never been happier. For clients who have their own a private property and would want to multiply their wealth using property as a platform, I am most willing to share with you how to go about doing it. 

If you have the intention to upgrade, downgrade, and sell your property, do call or whatsapp me. I will be most willing to assist you.",https://www.carousell.sg/p/free-property-consultation-261979105

I have been doing property for more than a decade and my expertise lies in HDB upgrading and downgrading for my clients. If you are simply considering a change of locations, I am the right  person  for you to seek advice. 

I used to stay in a 5-Room HDB flat in Sengkang, and at a young age of my twenties, I managed to buy my very own private property. We bought our first matrimonial flat under the walk in selection scheme which is now called balance sales of flats. When property market picked up, we sold it at a profit and shifted nearby my parents’ place. We bought a 4 room flat and when the property market picked up again, we sold the property at a profit and upgraded to a private property before I turned 30 years old. If you are considering the same options, you can achieve this too with the right calculations and planning. 

Like you, initially I was scared and definitely skeptical that I could not finance the loan. However, after doing some meticulous financial planning and calculations, I proceeded with the purchase. It was a decision which I have never regretted. To date, I have converted many of my clients clients to walk the same journey as me, and they have never been happier. For clients who have their own a private property and would want to multiply their wealth using property as a platform, I am most willing to share with you how to go about doing it. 

If you have the intention to upgrade, downgrade, and sell your property, do call or whatsapp me. I will be most willing to assist you.",https://www.carousell.sg/p/looking-to-sell-your-property-or-upgrade-i-can-help-with-your-property-related-matters-263369297

Congratulations for being one of the HDB owners to know how family after family upgrade their HDB and had felt stress-free during the process. Read on to understand how we guide you along this journey.

When we focus on the topic of upgrading from older flat
to new flats, we always look into a couple of factors that
can affect your monthly instalments and also long term
liability.

Below listed are some considerations you have to look into
when it comes to managing your next housing plan.

✅Should It Be HDB Loan Or Bank Loan?

✅Many Says That Bank Loan Is Not Safe. Is It Myth Or Fact?

✅Should I use all my CPF
for the purchase? 

✅How can I make my CPF work harder for me?

✅Home owners usually question the use of CPF for housing. Should
they utilize all for payment to the house? 

✅Many people actually say:”
For our generation, there is not much hope of seeing our CPF, why
not use it for housing.”

We do not agree with this statement. We had paid 5 figure prices to
attend courses on proper CPF planning and usage. These skill sets
and knowledge helps home owners save and map out a comfortable
route for retirement.

📌Do you know you can upgrade to condo with zero or minimum cash upfront?


🏘 Extra CASH proceeds of up to $100k for YOU

⚡Own another 1 or even 2 private properties for investment without paying extra CASH!

➡Before we begin on sharing the Pros and Cons
of Upgrading from Older to Newer Flats, let us
look into some of the most common
questions HDB owners have.

Have you thought of these questions before?

☑I have sufficient CPF in my account now.

💵Should I Fully Pay Off my current HDB loan?

🏠There are so many New Flats nowadays?
Can I upgrade to a bigger place or am I
eligible to change to a newer flat?

💰I Do Not Have much cash with me at the
moment, but I would like to change my living
environment. Will I be able to do it?

𝐀𝐯𝐨𝐢𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 $𝟏𝟎𝟎𝐤 𝐌𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐀𝐋𝐋 𝐇𝐃𝐁 𝐎𝐖𝐍𝐄𝐑 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰!!! 

I've been through this journey with many HDB home owners. Purchasing of 2nd property, growing assets
through the 10 years plan I drafted and lastly raise their family in an improved environment.

I have been doing property for more than a decade and my expertise lies in HDB upgrading and downgrading for my clients. If you are simply considering a change of locations, I am the right  person  for you to seek advice. 

I used to stay in a 5-Room HDB flat in Sengkang, and at a young age of my twenties, I managed to buy my very own private property. We bought our first matrimonial flat under the walk in selection scheme which is now called balance sales of flats. When property market picked up, we sold it at a profit and shifted nearby my parents’ place. We bought a 4 room flat and when the property market picked up again, we sold the property at a profit and upgraded to a private property before I turned 30 years old. If you are considering the same options, you can achieve this too with the right calculations and planning. 

Like you, initially I was scared and definitely skeptical that I could not finance the loan. However, after doing some meticulous financial planning and calculations, I proceeded with the purchase. It was a decision which I have never regretted. To date, I have converted many of my clients clients to walk the same journey as me, and they have never been happier. For clients who have their own a private property and would want to multiply their wealth using property as a platform, I am most willing to share with you how to go about doing it. 

If you have the intention to upgrade, downgrade, and sell your property, do call or whatsapp me. I will be most willing to assist you.",https://www.carousell.sg/p/looking-to-sell-your-property-or-upgrade-i-can-help-with-your-property-related-matters-263369297
